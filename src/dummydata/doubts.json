The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty). You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid. Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations."
